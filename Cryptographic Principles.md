Techniques required for secure communication:
**[[Encryption]]**
**Cryptographic hashing**
**Message Authentication Codes (MAC)**
**Digital Signatures**

Cryptography based on computational hard problems such as RSA and ElGamal but always suspect to a brute force attack even if a near (but finite) infinite set of time
