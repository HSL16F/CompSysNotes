A **communication protocol** is a system of rules that allows two or more entities of a [communications system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_system "Communications system") to transmit [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information "Information") via any variation of a [physical quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantity "Physical quantity"). The protocol defines the rules, [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax "Syntax"), [semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics_(computer_science) "Semantics (computer science)"), and [synchronization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization "Synchronization") of [communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication "Communication") and possible [error recovery methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction "Error detection and correction"). Protocols may be implemented by [hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware "Computer hardware"), [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software "Software"), or a combination of both.
Examples of a protocol stack includes:
HTTP, TCP, IP, etc with corresponding layers
HTTP  | Application
TCP    | Transport
IP       | Internet or network

[[TCP IP|TCP/IP]] and [[OSI]] are the focus of for this content though there exists many more

A protocol is the format and order of messages that are exchanges between two or more computers, routers, communication entities. Protocols are the rules that govern the exchange and the actions taking for transmission and receiving of communications on communication actions.
