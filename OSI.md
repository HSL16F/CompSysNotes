Open Systems Interconnection OSI can be thought of as an idealised model with some minor degree of flexibility.
Its designed to help reflect the thought process that should be followed when designing a network/diagnosing a fault. It is the core to a number of schema

The core principals:
- Layers should be created where a different abstraction is needed
- Each layer should perform a well defined function
- Function of each layer should be chosen with a view toward defining internationally standardised protocols
- Layer boundaries should be chosen to minimise the information flow across the interfaces
- There should be enough layers that distinct functions can act own there own and not grouped into same layers, however it should be small enough layers that there's not excessive layering and the architecture becomes too complex
